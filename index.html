                <h6>My name is Ralph Goffart Winkin, As I am writing this I am 18 years old, and I currently am studying Japanese in Japan, before getting back to Belgium to begin my bachelor of Engineering at
                    <a class="link" href=https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html>L'Université Catholique de Louvain.</a>
                    The University that I would like to attend to in the future is called l'<a class="link" href=https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr>Institut supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace</a>, in Toulouse, France. <br>
                    I am interested by quite a lot of things, such as space, learning languages, and of course computer science, but I believe that I can get myself interested in whatever there is in front of me. <br>
                    My hobbies include volleyball and running, reading, anime, travelling, as well as trying and learning new things. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends and doing karaoke.<br>
                    In the future, I would like to get a private pilot license, as it is something that has been attracting me very much for the last few years. I also am interested in getting a paramotor license <br>
                    I would also like to be able to read and speak more languages, at least at a B2 level. I can speak and read French, English, Japanese, and somewhat Spanish. My next targets are currently chinese and korean. I think 5 languages is a good goal for now.   <br>
                    My deadlines for achieving these (and the other projects in the <a class = "link" href="projects.html">next page</a>) is around 10 years, as of 2022.<br>
